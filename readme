This is the dockerization of a LAMP server.
It uses 2 docker containers: db and web
I made it easy to run: Just run ./refresh.sh from the docker shell
#####
Put your SQL code in sqlserver/data
Put your web code in webserver/src

Y'all are running windows, so you'll have to:
Install docker toolbox (which include docker-machine)
Always run docker commands in the docker shell
Run `docker-machine ip` to see the IP of the running webserver
